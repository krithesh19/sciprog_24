# Practical 4: Numerical Integration Using Trapezoidal Rule

This program calculates the area under a specified mathematical function using the trapezoidal rule. It approximates the area by dividing it into trapezoids and summing their areas.

## Files
- `Practical4.c`: Code for numerical integration using the trapezoidal rule.

## How It Works
1. **Initialize** variables for bounds and interval width.
2. **Apply Trapezoidal Rule** to approximate the integral.
3. **Output** the approximate area.

## Compilation and Execution
To compile and run the program:
```bash
gcc Practical4.c -o practical4
./practical4
