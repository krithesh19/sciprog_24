# Practical 8 - Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Calculation

This practical demonstrates how to calculate the GCD of two integers using both iterative and recursive methods.

- **gcd_iterative**: Implements the Euclidean algorithm in an iterative way.
  
- **gcd_recursive**: Uses recursion to calculate the GCD based on the Euclidean algorithm.

## How to Compile and Run

```sh

gcc -o practical8 practical8.c

./practical8
